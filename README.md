# Snap! Studio

A **Studio** to experiment and play with microcontrollers and devices _to connect our physical world_ to our **Snap!** projects and also to connect different projects together.

Yes, **it rocks!**

Our first goals:
- To Use **Web Serial API** to connect (directly) **microcontrollers to Snap!**
  + Experimenting and looking at Web Serial API features and limitations
  + Making a first Snap4Arduino distro based on this WSA
  + Designing a library to build current Snap4Arduino (and other) features directly into Snap!
  
- To Facilitate the connection of **different devices and components to Snap!** 
  + Document ways to connect different devices to Snap!
  + Create firmware modifications for special devices or components
  + Using firmata, direct serial and other solutions...
  (Arduinos, ESPs, micro:bits, Raspberrys...)
